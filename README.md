# What is OCD?

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common, chronic, and long-lasting disorder in which a person has uncontrollable, reoccurring thoughts ("obsessions") and/or behaviors ("compulsions") that he or she feels the urge to repeat over and over.

## Signs and Symptoms



People with OCD may have symptoms of obsessions, compulsions, or both. These symptoms can interfere with all aspects of life, such as work, school, and personal relationships.

Obsessions are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety. Common symptoms include:

    Fear of germs or contamination
    Unwanted forbidden or taboo thoughts involving sex, religion, or harm
    Aggressive thoughts towards others or self
    Having things symmetrical or in a perfect order

Compulsions are repetitive behaviors that a person with OCD feels the urge to do in response to an obsessive thought. Common compulsions include:

    Excessive cleaning and/or handwashing
    Ordering and arranging things in a particular, precise way
    Repeatedly checking on things, such as repeatedly checking to see if the door is locked or that the oven is off
    Compulsive counting

Not all rituals or habits are compulsions. Everyone double checks things sometimes. But a person with OCD generally:

    Can't control his or her thoughts or behaviors, even when those thoughts or behaviors are recognized as excessive
    Spends at least 1 hour a day on these thoughts or behaviors
    Doesn’t get pleasure when performing the behaviors or rituals, but may feel brief relief from the anxiety the thoughts cause
    Experiences significant problems in their daily life due to these thoughts or behaviors

Some individuals with OCD also have a tic disorder. Motor tics are sudden, brief, repetitive movements, such as eye blinking and other eye movements, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, and head or shoulder jerking. Common vocal tics include repetitive throat-clearing, sniffing, or grunting sounds.

Symptoms may come and go, ease over time, or worsen. People with OCD may try to help themselves by avoiding situations that trigger their obsessions, or they may use alcohol or drugs to calm themselves. Although most adults with OCD recognize that what they are doing doesn’t make sense, some adults and most children may not realize that their behavior is out of the ordinary. Parents or teachers typically recognize OCD symptoms in children.

If you think you have OCD, talk to your health care provider about your symptoms. If left untreated, OCD can interfere in all aspects of life.

## Treatment
Medications are one way to reduce the symptoms but ERP is the only effective way to treat it completely. To begin ERP, you need to have an idea about your thought patterns and compulsions, this app will help you identify them
